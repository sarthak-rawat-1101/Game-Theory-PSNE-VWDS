# Game-Theory-PSNE-VWDS

This is part of Introduction To Game Theory course.

Task is to find PSNE and very weakly dominant stratigies of an N-player game.

## Input format:
- First line containe 'N', an integer denoting number of players.
- Second line contains 'N' space seperated integers, denoting number of \
  strategies of each player.
- Third line contains utility matrix in NFG format.
## Output format:
- Number denoting count of PSNE profiles, 'N_psne'.
- Next 'N_psne' lines contain 'N' space seperated numbers each, \
  denoting a strategy profile that is PSNE.
- Next 'N' lines contain very weakly dominant strategy for each player. \
  Player 1 to Player 'N'.
